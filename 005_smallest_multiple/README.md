# Smallest Multiple Test

[ProjectEuler+ Smallest Multiple](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler005)

This test, despite being assessed a difficulty level of *medium*, was actually pretty trivial.
It's therefore likely that there is a more sophisticated solution, but the one I submitted was
accurate and fast enough to avoid the time limit failure.
