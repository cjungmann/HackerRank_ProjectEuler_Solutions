# HackerRank ProjectEuler+ Competition Solutions

As I use local source files to develop and test my solutions,
I'm saving them in [my github account](https://github.com/cjungmann)
so that I can refer to them later for ideas.

For now I'm putting all the solutions in a single repository.  It
is easier than making a new repository for each solution.  It may not
be a "best practice", and it may change later if I decide that
separate projects are appropriate.

The first two digits of each solution refer to the test number
in the competition.
